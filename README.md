## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://tea.surillya.com/Surillyacom/THOS-Server.git
   cd THOS-Server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S php
   ```

3. Launch local server (as sudo):

   ```bash
   sudo php -S 0.0.0.0:80
   ```

4. Access it in your browser: [http://localhost](http://localhost)

## üîí Security

The server runs per default as sudo, since it's intended to run server-side commands. This may lead to security issues, so don't just expose it to the web, or give anyone access! And watch out for what apps you install - we recommend only installing *verified* apps from the official THOS store!

## üß† Behind the Scenes

THOS is designed to run on a minimalistic Linux distro with kiosk capabilities. It ties together:

* Firefox in kiosk mode
* Local server logic for user interaction
* Persistent configuration for headless reboots
